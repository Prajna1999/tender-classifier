While the tender does not explicitly mention flood-related keywords, the construction of a retaining wall in a specific location near a college and hospital suggests that the primary purpose of the project is to address potential flood-related issues in the area. Retaining walls are often used as a flood mitigation measure to prevent water from entering or damaging buildings and infrastructure. Additionally, the location of the project, near a college and hospital, indicates that the retaining wall is likely intended to protect these important facilities from potential flood events.

However, the tender does not provide any additional details about the flood risk or history of the area, nor does it mention any specific flood-related objectives or emergency response considerations.

The project is being undertaken by the Public Works Roads Department, which suggests a focus on infrastructure development.

The description mentions the construction of a box cell culvert, which is a type of drainage structure commonly used to manage water flow and prevent flooding in flood-prone areas. The location of the project, Nonoi Dakhinpat Road, is not explicitly stated to be a flood-prone area, but the inclusion of a culvert construction project indicates that the area may be susceptible to water-related issues, such as flooding or waterlogging.

Additionally, the project is being undertaken as part of the Chief Minister's Road Construction Scheme, which suggests a broader focus on infrastructure development and improvement, rather than a specific flood-related initiative.

Given the presence of a flood-related infrastructure component (the box cell culvert) and the potential for the project to address water-related issues in the area, the tender can be classified as Flood-related, albeit with some uncertainty due to the lack of explicit mention of flood-related keywords or the specific flood-prone nature of the project location.",Flood,success,
