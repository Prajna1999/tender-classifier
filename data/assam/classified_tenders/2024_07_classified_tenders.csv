The description mentions the construction of a box cell culvert, which is a type of drainage structure commonly used to manage water flow and prevent flooding in flood-prone areas. The location of the project, Nonoi Dakhinpat Road, is not explicitly stated to be a flood-prone area, but the inclusion of a culvert construction project indicates that the area may be susceptible to water-related issues, such as flooding or waterlogging.

Additionally, the project is being undertaken as part of the Chief Minister's Road Construction Scheme, which suggests a broader focus on infrastructure development and improvement, rather than a specific flood-related initiative.

Given the presence of a flood-related infrastructure component (the box cell culvert) and the potential for the project to address water-related issues in the area, the tender can be classified as Flood-related, albeit with some uncertainty due to the lack of explicit mention of flood-related keywords or the specific flood-prone nature of the project location.",Flood,success,
