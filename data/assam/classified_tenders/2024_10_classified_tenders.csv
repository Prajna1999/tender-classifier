The project is being undertaken by the Bodoland Territorial Council's Panchayat and Rural Development department.

The tender includes keywords related to flood-related infrastructure, such as ""embankment formation"" and ""surface grading"", which are commonly used in flood protection and mitigation projects. Additionally, the project is being carried out under the 6th ASFC, which suggests that it may be part of a larger flood management or disaster response program.

The temporal factor of the project being carried out during the pre-monsoon season also indicates that it may be a flood-related preparatory work.

Based on the presence of flood-related keywords, the project's association with a disaster response program, and the timing of the work, this tender can be classified as a flood-related infrastructure project.",Flood,success,
