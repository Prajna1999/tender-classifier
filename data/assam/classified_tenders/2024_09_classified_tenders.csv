The project is being undertaken by the Public Works Roads Department.

While the tender does not explicitly mention flood-related works, the construction of a stone masonry guard wall along the road suggests that the project may have a flood mitigation or prevention component. Roads in flood-prone areas often require reinforcement and protection measures to withstand water damage and prevent erosion. Additionally, the SOPD-G scheme is a general development program, which could potentially include flood-related infrastructure projects.

However, the tender does not provide clear evidence that the primary purpose of the project is flood-related. The description focuses on road improvement and construction, without any specific mention of flood protection or management. The temporal factors, such as the season and urgency, are also not provided.

Given the ambiguity in the tender details, it is difficult to determine with high confidence whether this project is primarily flood-related or not.
