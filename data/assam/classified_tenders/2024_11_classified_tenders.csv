While the tender does not explicitly mention flood-related keywords, the location and the nature of the infrastructure project suggest that it may be related to flood management or mitigation. Bridges are often critical components of flood-prone areas, as they need to be designed to withstand and manage flood waters. Additionally, the Assam State Bridge Infrastructure Program is likely focused on improving the resilience of the state's bridge network, which is crucial during flood events. Therefore, while the tender does not directly state that it is a flood-related project, the context and the nature of the work suggest that it may be classified as a flood-related infrastructure project.",Flood,success,
