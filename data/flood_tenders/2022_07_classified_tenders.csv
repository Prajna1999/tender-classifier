While the tender does not explicitly mention flood-related works, the description suggests that it is a water management project, which could be relevant in the context of flood-prone areas.

The tender is issued by the HP Irrigation and Public Health department, which is responsible for water infrastructure and management, including flood control measures. However, the tender does not provide any specific details about the project's purpose or its relation to flood prevention or mitigation.

Given the lack of clear flood-related keywords or explicit mention of flood-related infrastructure, this tender appears to be more focused on general water supply and infrastructure improvement, rather than a dedicated flood-related project. The temporal factors, such as the season, are also not provided, making it difficult to determine if this is a pre-monsoon or post-flood restoration work.",Non-Flood,success,

The key points are:

1. The title and description mention ""Remodeling of FIS Tipra to Shillu Kalan and Tipra to Chaha"" which suggests this is a flood irrigation system (FIS) project. Remodeling of FIS systems is often done to improve flood management and water distribution in flood-prone areas.

2. The sub-heads mention ""Construction of Cement concrete main channel and field channel"", ""Construction of head weir at Tipra Nallah"", and ""Construction of 6 Nos out"". These are all flood-related infrastructure components like channels, weirs, and outlets that are typically built for flood control and water management.

3. The project is located in Solan district of Himachal Pradesh, which is a hilly region prone to flash floods and landslides during the monsoon season.

4. The tender is from the Irrigation and Public Health department, which is the primary agency responsible for flood management and water infrastructure in the state.

Based on these factors, this tender appears to be focused on flood-related infrastructure development and water management, rather than general construction or maintenance work. The project scope and location indicate it is a flood mitigation and control measure.",Flood,success,

While the tender does not explicitly state that this is a flood-related project, the presence of drainage infrastructure and the mention of the SCSP (Scheduled Caste Sub-Plan) program suggest that this project may be aimed at improving flood resilience and drainage in the area.

The tender does not provide information about the specific location or the flood-prone nature of the area, but the inclusion of culverts and drains indicates that the project is likely intended to address water management and potential flood-related issues. Additionally, the timing of the tender is not specified, so it is unclear if this is a pre-monsoon or post-flood restoration project.

Overall, the tender details suggest that this project has a flood-related component, even if it is not the primary focus. The drainage infrastructure and the SCSP program involvement indicate that the project may have some flood mitigation or management aspects, but the lack of explicit flood-related language and the broader scope of the project make the classification somewhat ambiguous.",Ambiguous,success,

The key details are:

- The tender is for the deployment of labor for 180 days, which suggests it is a routine operation and maintenance activity rather than a flood-related project.
- The water supply schemes mentioned (LWSS Maharal Dakhyora, LWSS Samtana, LWSS Dhangota, LWSS Desan Kharota) are general infrastructure for water supply and do not appear to be specifically related to flood management or prevention.
- The tender is not associated with any flood-related keywords or context, such as flood protection, embankment construction, drainage systems, or erosion control.
- The tender does not mention any temporal factors like pre-monsoon preparation or post-flood restoration, indicating it is not a seasonal or emergency flood-related work.
- The department involved is the Irrigation and Public Health department, which is responsible for general water infrastructure and not specifically flood management.

While the tender does not explicitly mention flood-related works, the construction of a large water storage facility in a specific location suggests that the project may be aimed at improving water management and potentially mitigating flood-related issues in the area. The staging height of the OHSR indicates that it may be designed to withstand potential flood levels.

However, the tender does not provide any direct references to flood protection, prevention, or emergency response, which are the primary indicators for a flood-related project.

While the tender does not explicitly mention flood-related works, the construction of a large water storage facility in a specific location could be considered a secondary indicator of flood-related infrastructure. Water management projects, especially in flood-prone areas, can be important for flood mitigation and prevention. Additionally, the tender is being issued by the Irrigation and Public Health Department, which suggests a focus on water-related infrastructure.

While the description mentions the construction of road-side drains, it does not explicitly state that this is for flood-related infrastructure or flood prevention/mitigation purposes. The tender does not mention any keywords related to flood protection, embankments, or emergency response facilities for floods.

However, the location of the project in an industrial area that is prone to flooding could suggest that the road-side drains are intended to improve drainage and reduce the impact of floods in the area. Additionally, the timing of the tender, which does not specify a season, could indicate that it is a pre-monsoon preparation work.

Overall, the tender details do not provide clear evidence that this is a flood-related project, but the inclusion of drainage works in an industrial area prone to flooding suggests a potential flood mitigation aspect.

The tender description suggests that this project is primarily aimed at improving and upgrading the existing flood irrigation infrastructure in the region. Flood irrigation systems are typically used in areas prone to flooding or high water levels, and the maintenance and enhancement of these systems can be considered a flood-related activity.

Additionally, the location of the project in the Sarkaghat region, which is part of the Mandi district in Himachal Pradesh, is a flood-prone area that experiences significant rainfall and water-related challenges. The involvement of the Irrigation and Public Health Department, which is responsible for managing water resources and infrastructure, further indicates the flood-related nature of this project.

However, the tender does not contain any primary indicators of direct flood protection or prevention works, nor does it mention flood-related infrastructure like embankments, dykes, or drainage systems. The project also appears to be a routine water supply scheme rather than an emergency or urgent flood response measure.

Given the lack of clear flood-related context and the primary purpose being a general water supply project, the classification is more likely to be non-flood-related. There is no strong evidence to suggest this is a flood-specific tender, and the water supply aspect seems to be the main focus.",Non-Flood,success,

However, the fact that it is being undertaken by the Irrigation and Public Health department implies that there may be some flood-related considerations, even if they are not the primary purpose.

Given the ambiguity in the tender details, it is difficult to definitively classify this as either a flood-related or non-flood-related project.

The tender is for providing unskilled labor for the town and surrounding area under the LWSS Nahan Town, which indicates that the project is likely focused on maintaining and improving the water supply infrastructure in the region. This could be a secondary indicator of flood-related work, as water management projects in flood-prone areas can be considered part of flood mitigation efforts.

Additionally, the tender is for a project in the Nahan Circle, which is located in the Sirmour district of Himachal Pradesh. This region is prone to flooding during the monsoon season, which could make the maintenance and repair of the LWSS a critical component of flood preparedness and response.

However, the tender does not provide any explicit details about the specific flood-related aspects of the project, such as the construction of embankments, dykes, or drainage systems. The description also does not mention any emergency response or disaster management components.

Given the ambiguity in the tender details, it is difficult to determine with high confidence whether this project is primarily flood-related or not.

However, the tender does not provide clear details on the specific flood-prevention or mitigation measures, if any, that are part of the project.

Additionally, the tender does not mention any temporal factors like pre-monsoon preparation or post-flood restoration, which would be more indicative of a flood-related project.",Ambiguous,success,

This indicates that the primary purpose of the work is to build a bridge to improve road connectivity, rather than a direct flood protection or prevention measure.

However, the tender mentions that the bridge is being constructed on the Silh to Dodru road, which suggests that the location is prone to flooding or water-related issues. The construction of a bridge over a nallah (stream or small river) also implies the need to address potential flood or drainage concerns in the area.

While the tender does not explicitly state that the project is for flood-related infrastructure, the context of the bridge construction over a nallah in a flood-prone area suggests that it may have a secondary flood mitigation or management purpose. The project could help maintain connectivity and access during flood events, even if it is not the primary objective.

Given the ambiguity in the tender details, it is difficult to classify this project as either purely flood-related or non-flood-related. The bridge construction seems to have a dual purpose of improving road connectivity and potentially addressing flood-related issues in the area.",Ambiguous,success,

- Laying of concrete pavement and tarring at various road sections

These indicate that the primary purpose of this tender is to carry out flood protection and mitigation measures along the Bandi Matiyari Mumta road in Kangra district. The tender does not mention any specific season or urgency, but the inclusion of pre-monsoon preparatory works suggests this is likely a planned flood management project.

The department involved is the Public Works Department (PWD), which is commonly responsible for infrastructure development and maintenance, including flood-related works. The overall scale and scope of the project, covering a significant length of road, also points towards a comprehensive flood management initiative.

While the tender does not explicitly use the term ""flood"" in the title or description, the presence of multiple flood-related components and the involvement of the PWD department provide sufficient context to classify this as a flood-related infrastructure project.",Flood,success,
